In order to prevent issues in the carry out from large subtractions
(IE, -1 - 1 - 1, which will overflow the carry if you simply use the
ninth bit of a short), I use A + ~MDR + C to calculate the result of SBC.
Below is the proof that this statement is the same as A - MDR - (1 - C),
which is the true definition of SBC.

We know that -MDR = ~MDR + 1
So ~MDR = -MDR - 1
And A + ~MDR + C = A - MDR - 1 + C.
By the distributive property, A - MDR - 1 + C = A - MDR - (1 - C).
Therefore, the statement is true.
