Here's a semi-complete list of things that still need to be changed:
  - A few files are still missing descriptions.
  - Pretty much everything needs to be more rigorously tested.
  - SDL, APU, NDB are all completely missing.
  - PPU is only half finished.

Next up:
  - NES 2.0 parsing needs to be written.
  - CPU still needs a little more cleaning.
  - SDL rendering needs to be implemented.

Small issues:
  - UxROM PRG-ROM offset calculation currently assumes there is not trainer.
  - UxROM has no error detection on creation.
  - UxROM does not implement four screen nametables. Not part of the spec, but
    needed for full homebrew compatibility.
  - Many files include needless headers.
  - Initialization error checking is abysmal. Ex. Palette can fail but the ppu
    doesnt do anything about it so the program still segfaults.
  - Contracts are used almost nowhere.
