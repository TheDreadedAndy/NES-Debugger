Here's a semi-complete list of things that still need to be changes:
  - A few files are still missing descriptions.
  - Pretty much everything needs to be more rigorously tested.
  - SDL, PPU, APU, NDB are all completely missing.
  - Consider parsing the INES/NES2 header into a structure.

Next up:
  - Header parsing needs to be written.
  - VRAM needs to be implemented so that true work on the ppu can begin.
  - CPU is still an absolute mess.
