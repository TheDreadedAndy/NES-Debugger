Here's a semi-complete list of things that still need to be changes:
  - A few files are still missing descriptions.
  - Pretty much everything needs to be more rigorously tested.
  - SDL, PPU, APU, NDB are all completely missing.

Next up:
  - NES 2.0 parsing needs to be written.
  - Regfile and state need to be globalized
  - VRAM needs to be implemented so that true work on the ppu can begin.
  - CPU is still an absolute mess, style wise.

Small issues:
  - UxROM PRG-ROM offset calculation currently assumes there is not trainer.
  - UxROM has no error detection on creation.
  - Many files include needless headers.
