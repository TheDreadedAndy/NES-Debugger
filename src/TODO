Here's a semi-complete list of things that still need to be changes:
  - BRK needs interrupt hijacking to be implemented.
  - Absolute indexed and indirrect instructions need to be implemented.
  - It's worth it to consider changing interrupt detection to be managed by
    state, though this may not be necessary.
  - A few files are still missing descriptions.
  - Pretty much everything needs to be more rigorously tested.
  - SDL, PPU, APU, NDB are all completely missing.
